We created the LikEat restaurant review website. Visually we have been inspired by the e-table page. While the code for the backend has been written in Spring-boot and the code for the frontend in React.

Basically in the app there are 3 different users customer, client and admin with different permissions each. The customer can view all the restaurants listed on the website with the ability to rate each one, and can search for one through the various filters available. The client has the ability to create a restaurant on the website, but until it is approved by an admin it will not be accessible by the customer. Still he can like the customer can view and search for a restaurant without being able to rate it. The admin is responsible for the proper functioning of the website. He can view and search for a restaurant without being able to rate it, view all users with the ability to delete them if deemed appropriate, add other admins and even view and delete all restaurants he has approved as well as specific reviews. Finally, he has the possibility to reject the inclusion of a restaurant on the website if it does not meet the necessary criteria.
